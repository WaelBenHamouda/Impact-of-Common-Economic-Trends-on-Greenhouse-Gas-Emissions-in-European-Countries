# Impact of Common Economic Trends on Greenhouse Gas Emissions in European Countries

This project analyzes how common economic trends influence greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 18 European countries between 1995 and 2020. By extracting macroeconomic trends and applying advanced econometric models, the study assesses whether economic growth aligns with environmental objectives.

# Summary

The analysis uses:
	•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA): To extract underlying economic trends (GDP per capita, industrial activity, oil consumption, etc.).
	•	Panel Data Econometrics: Interactive fixed effects models to account for unobserved heterogeneity across countries.
	•	Scope: 18 European countries over 25 years.
	•	Application: Linking extracted trends to CO₂ emissions trajectories and identifying cross-country heterogeneity.

# Conclusion

The study reveals heterogeneous effects of economic growth on emissions. Some countries align their economic trends with reductions in GHG emissions, reflecting effective climate policies, while others experience increased emissions tied to structural dependence on energy-intensive industries. These findings stress the importance of differentiated climate strategies across Europe.
